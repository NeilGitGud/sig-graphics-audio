# Editor component Punctual/Area Lights Workflow Tests
Testing in this area should focus on the Punctual/Area Lights components.

## **General Docs**
* [O3DE Learn: Light Component](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/components/reference/atom/light/)

## Common Issues to Watch For
 - Crashes, soft-locks, hangs when launching Editor.exe or adding a component.
 - When a component settings value is changed, it has a visual impact on the level. 
   - The change can be subtle, but if no change is present log an issue


## Workflows
- Create various entities with meshes and materials and place them in the space. 
  - Explore each light type and place them against/around these points. 
    - Utilize various shapes and sizes 
    - disk/Spherical/Capsule are all good lights to create and mix. 
    - Try to make several different configurations of lights against the same mesh and confirm they correctly shift and display to your expectations.

## Prepare the level
Prepare a simple level for all workflows to be ran against
- Launch the editor, and create a new level with default settings 
- Disable or delete the Sun entity
- Add one or two extra entities with mesh components and a material (Examples: "bunny.fbx", and "suzanne.fbx")   

### Suggested Time Box: 
15 minutes per workflow per platform. Note that the workflow below is the basic steps, feel free to experiment with other settings during the remaining time.



Explore "Point (sphere)" Light component 
-------------------------------------
Lights have a specific location and radiate light equally in all directions, this version has a sphere shaped emitter. The attenuation value determines how fast the light drops off as you travel further from the light origin. Low attenuation values will spread the light further, while high attenuation values will keep it more compact.
